_Investigating privacy practices of online social network (OSN) users is a difficult task because (a) these practices rely on technical privacy controls combined with various other strategies like self-censorship or information obfuscation, and (b) for practical reasons, it is difficult to actually observe this complex user behavior and practices in such digital environments. We iteratively developed a research design that combines (a) participant observation with a privacy-friendly tracking tool for user actions and privacy settings in OSN, and (b) qualitative semi-structured interviews. Applying the research software requires little extra effort but considerably improves our interviews with participants and the later data analysis. However this benefit comes for the cost of developing our toolkit. We are wondering whether there is more potential in the research community to (collaboratively) develop similar toolkits allowing significant improvements of research outcomes with limited extra effort in study execution._
